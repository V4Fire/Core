# core/then

This module provides a class wraps promise-like objects and adds to them some extra functionality, such as possibility of cancellation, etc.

Mind that this module is deprecated and will be removed from the next major release of the library. You can use modules from [core/promise/abortable](src_core_promise_abortable.html) instead of this.
