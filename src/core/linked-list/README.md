# core/linked-list

This module provides a class to organize a doubly [[LinkedList]] data structure.
The linked list contains [[Link]]

## API

The base API is pretty close to a JS array: `push/unshift`, `pop/shift`, `length`.
The API declares `head` and `tail` to get the first and last elements from a linked list and `clear` to clear the whole list.
